I'm a Brazilian Mechatronics Engineer with a passion for all things related to Data Science. My background in Python, C++, and SQL made me eager to face all trends related to this incredible field, as well as the challenges that appear. I’m always looking to collaborate on Data Science Projects, so reach out to me.
